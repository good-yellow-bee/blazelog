# BlazeLog Server Configuration
#
# This is an example configuration file for the BlazeLog server.
# Copy and modify as needed.

server:
  # gRPC listen address for agent connections
  grpc_address: ":9443"

  # HTTP listen address for REST API (future)
  http_address: ":8080"

  # TLS configuration for mTLS (mutual TLS)
  # Generate certificates with: blazelog ca init && blazelog cert server
  tls:
    # Enable mTLS (set to false for insecure mode during development)
    enabled: false

    # Server certificate file
    # cert_file: "/etc/blazelog/certs/server.crt"

    # CA certificate for verifying client certificates
    # client_ca_file: "/etc/blazelog/certs/ca.crt"

# SSH security settings

  # Default: /etc/blazelog/known_hosts (server) or ~/.blazelog/known_hosts (agent)
  host_key_file: "/etc/blazelog/known_hosts"

  # Host key verification policy:
  #   strict - reject unknown hosts (most secure, requires pre-configured known_hosts)
  #   tofu   - trust on first use, reject on key change (balanced, default)
  #   warn   - accept all, log warnings (dev only, not recommended for production)
